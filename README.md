Classifying Cancerous Genetic Mutation Variations

## About
For this project, I used a variety of classification models to categorize the malignancy of genetic mutation variations based on data derived from the text of expertly annotated scientific literature. The ultimate ensemble classification model is based on exploration using Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVMs, and Random Forests.
